Integrating the OpenAI Agents SDK with Rust’s Burn framework allows you to run AI models locally, eliminating the need for external API calls to large language models (LLMs). This setup enhances performance and ensures data privacy. Here’s a step-by-step guide to achieve this integration:

---

**1. Set Up the OpenAI Agents SDK**

  

Begin by cloning the OpenAI Agents SDK repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python.git
```

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```
cd openai-agents-python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This SDK is designed to facilitate the creation and management of AI agents. By default, it interacts with OpenAI’s LLMs, but we’ll modify it to utilize a local Rust-based model.

---

**2. Develop a Rust-Based AI Model Using Burn**

  

Burn is a Rust-native deep learning framework that emphasizes performance and flexibility. To create and train a model:

• **Initialize a New Rust Project:**

```
cargo new rust_ai_model
cd rust_ai_model
```

  

• **Add Dependencies:**

Update your Cargo.toml to include Burn and Serde:

```
[dependencies]
burn = { version = "0.10", features = ["ndarray"] }
burn-model = "0.10"
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
```

  

• **Define and Train Your Model:**

In src/main.rs, implement your neural network, train it, and serialize the trained model to a .burn file. For detailed guidance, refer to the blog post on integrating Rust’s Burn framework for AI.

---

**3. Create Python Bindings with PyO3**

  

To enable the OpenAI Agents SDK to interact with the Rust-based model, we’ll use PyO3 to create Python bindings:

• **Add PyO3 to Your Rust Project:**

Modify your Cargo.toml:

```
[dependencies]
pyo3 = { version = "0.15", features = ["extension-module"] }
burn = { version = "0.10", features = ["ndarray"] }
burn-model = "0.10"
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]
```

  

• **Implement Python Bindings:**

In src/lib.rs, load the serialized .burn model and define a function to run inference:

```
use burn::tensor::{Tensor, backend::NdArrayBackend};
use burn::model::Model;
use pyo3::prelude::*;
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::BufReader;

#[pyfunction]
fn predict(input_data: Vec<f32>) -> PyResult<Vec<f32>> {
    // Load the model
    let file = File::open("trained_model.burn").expect("Failed to open model file");
    let reader = BufReader::new(file);
    let model: SimpleNN = SimpleNN::load(reader).expect("Failed to load model");

    // Convert input data to a tensor
    let input_tensor = Tensor::<NdArrayBackend, 2>::from_data(vec![input_data]);

    // Run inference
    let output_tensor = model.forward(input_tensor);

    // Convert the output tensor to a Vec<f32>
    let output_data = output_tensor.into_data().to_vec();

    Ok(output_data)
}

#[pymodule]
fn rust_ai_model(py: Python, m: &PyModule) -> PyResult<()> {
    m.add_function(wrap_pyfunction!(predict, m)?)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

  

• **Build the Python Module:**

Ensure you have maturin installed:

```
pip install maturin
```

Then, build the module:

```
maturin develop
```

This command compiles the Rust code into a Python-compatible shared library.

---

**4. Integrate the Rust Model with the OpenAI Agents SDK**

  

With the Python bindings in place, modify the OpenAI Agents SDK to utilize the local Rust-based model:

• **Import the Rust Module:**

In the relevant Python script within the SDK, import the Rust-based prediction function:

```
from rust_ai_model import predict
```

  

• **Replace LLM API Calls:**

Identify where the SDK makes calls to external LLMs and replace those with calls to the predict function:

```
def get_model_response(input_text):
    # Preprocess input_text to match the model's expected input format
    input_data = preprocess(input_text)
    
    # Run inference using the Rust-based model
    output_data = predict(input_data)
    
    # Postprocess the output_data to obtain the response text
    response_text = postprocess(output_data)
    
    return response_text
```

Ensure that the input and output data formats align with what the Rust model expects and returns.

---

**5. Test the Integrated System**

  

After integration, thoroughly test the system:

• **Functionality Testing:** Verify that the AI agent behaves as expected when interacting with the Rust-based model.

• **Performance Evaluation:** Assess the inference speed and compare it to previous implementations.

• **Resource Monitoring:** Check CPU and memory usage to ensure the system operates efficiently.

---

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate the OpenAI Agents SDK with a locally running Rust-based AI model using the Burn framework.
