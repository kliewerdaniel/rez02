# Building an AI Travel Planner with AutoGen: A Step-by-Step Guide

This guide will help you create an AI-powered travel planner using Microsoft's AutoGen framework. The application will utilize multiple AI agents to collaborate and plan a personalized travel itinerary based on user preferences. We'll use Python and the AgentChat API of AutoGen to build this system.

## Introduction

AutoGen is an open-source framework for building AI agent systems. It simplifies the creation of event-driven, distributed, scalable, and resilient agentic applications. In this guide, we'll build an AI Travel Planner where different AI agents collaborate to plan a travel itinerary based on user input.

**Use Case:** An AI Travel Planner that interacts with the user to gather preferences and coordinates multiple specialized agents (FlightAgent, HotelAgent, ActivityAgent) to plan flights, accommodations, and activities.

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** installed on your machine.
- **OpenAI API Key**: Obtain one from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
- **Terminal Access**: Ability to run commands in your operating system's terminal.
- **Git** (optional): For version control.
- **Basic Knowledge of Python**: Understanding of Python programming and asynchronous programming with `asyncio`.

---

## Project Setup

### 1. Create a Project Directory

Open your terminal and create a new directory for the project:

```bash
mkdir ai_travel_planner
cd ai_travel_planner
```

### 2. Initialize a Git Repository (Optional)

```bash
git init
```

### 3. Create a Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

### 4. Activate the Virtual Environment

- On **Linux/macOS**:

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- On **Windows**:

  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

---

## Installing Dependencies

### 1. Upgrade `pip`

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

### 2. Install AutoGen Packages

Install the required AutoGen packages and the OpenAI extension:

```bash
pip install 'autogen-agentchat==0.4.0.dev8' 'autogen-ext[openai]==0.4.0.dev8'
```

### 3. Install `python-dotenv` for Environment Variables

```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```

---

## Creating the Agents

We'll create four agents:

1. **UserAgent**: Interacts with the user to gather preferences.
2. **FlightAgent**: Handles flight booking queries.
3. **HotelAgent**: Handles accommodation booking.
4. **ActivityAgent**: Suggests activities based on destination.

---

### **1. UserAgent**

This agent will initiate the conversation with the user, gather preferences, and coordinate with other agents.

**Code: `user_agent.py`**

```python
# user_agent.py

from autogen_agentchat.agents import UserProxyAgent
from autogen_agentchat.message import AssistantMessage

class UserAgent(UserProxyAgent):
    pass  # Inherits functionality from UserProxyAgent
```

---

### **2. FlightAgent**

Handles flight-related queries and bookings.

**Code: `flight_agent.py`**

```python
# flight_agent.py

import asyncio
from autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent
from autogen_ext.models import OpenAIChatCompletionClient

async def search_flights(departure_city: str, destination_city: str, departure_date: str, return_date: str):
    # Mock implementation of flight search
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate network delay
    return f"Found flights from {departure_city} to {destination_city} departing on {departure_date} and returning on {return_date}."

flight_agent = AssistantAgent(
    name="FlightAgent",
    model_client=OpenAIChatCompletionClient(
        model="gpt-4",
        # api_key will be loaded from environment variable
    ),
    instructions="""
You are an AI agent specialized in booking flights. Assist in finding flights based on user preferences.
""",
    tools=[search_flights],
)
```

---

### **3. HotelAgent**

Handles accommodation queries and bookings.

**Code: `hotel_agent.py`**

```python
# hotel_agent.py

import asyncio
from autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent
from autogen_ext.models import OpenAIChatCompletionClient

async def search_hotels(destination_city: str, check_in_date: str, check_out_date: str):
    # Mock implementation of hotel search
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate network delay
    return f"Found hotels in {destination_city} from {check_in_date} to {check_out_date}."

hotel_agent = AssistantAgent(
    name="HotelAgent",
    model_client=OpenAIChatCompletionClient(
        model="gpt-4",
    ),
    instructions="""
You are an AI agent specialized in booking accommodations. Assist in finding hotels based on user preferences.
""",
    tools=[search_hotels],
)
```

---

### **4. ActivityAgent**

Suggests activities at the destination.

**Code: `activity_agent.py`**

```python
# activity_agent.py

import asyncio
from autogen_agentchat.agents import AssistantAgent
from autogen_ext.models import OpenAIChatCompletionClient

async def suggest_activities(destination_city: str, interests: str):
    # Mock implementation of activity suggestions
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate processing time
    return f"Suggested activities in {destination_city} based on your interests ({interests}): Visit the museum, explore downtown, enjoy local cuisine."

activity_agent = AssistantAgent(
    name="ActivityAgent",
    model_client=OpenAIChatCompletionClient(
        model="gpt-4",
    ),
    instructions="""
You are an AI agent specialized in suggesting activities and attractions. Provide recommendations based on user interests.
""",
    tools=[suggest_activities],
)
```

---

## Implementing the Main Program

We'll now create the main script that ties everything together.

**Code: `main.py`**

```python
# main.py

import asyncio
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from autogen_agentchat.agents import UserProxyAgent
from autogen_agentchat.teams import SequentialTeam
from autogen_agentchat.task import Console
from autogen_ext.models import OpenAIChatCompletionClient

# Import agents
from flight_agent import flight_agent
from hotel_agent import hotel_agent
from activity_agent import activity_agent

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()
openai_api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")

# Ensure API key is set
if not openai_api_key:
    raise ValueError("OPENAI_API_KEY is not set in the environment variables.")

# Set the API key for model clients
flight_agent.model_client.api_key = openai_api_key
hotel_agent.model_client.api_key = openai_api_key
activity_agent.model_client.api_key = openai_api_key

async def main():
    # Create the user agent
    user_agent = UserProxyAgent(
        name="UserAgent",
    )

    # Define the travel planning team
    travel_team = SequentialTeam(
        agents=[
            flight_agent,
            hotel_agent,
            activity_agent,
        ],
        user_agent=user_agent,
    )

    # Initial user message
    user_message = input("You: ")

    # Run the team
    stream = travel_team.run_stream(task=user_message)
    await Console(stream)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

---

## Running the Application

### 1. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project directory:

```bash
touch .env
```

Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file:

```ini
# .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

**Note:** Replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual API key.

### 2. Run the Application

```bash
python main.py
```

### 3. Interact with the Travel Planner

**Example Interaction:**

```
You: I want to plan a trip to Paris from New York next month.

FlightAgent: Found flights from New York to Paris departing on 2024-12-01 and returning on 2024-12-10.

HotelAgent: Found hotels in Paris from 2024-12-01 to 2024-12-10.

ActivityAgent: Suggested activities in Paris based on your interests (art, history): Visit the Louvre Museum, explore the Eiffel Tower, enjoy local French cuisine.
```

## Conclusion

You've successfully built an AI Travel Planner using AutoGen! This application demonstrates how multiple AI agents can collaborate to perform complex tasks. Each agent specializes in a particular domain and communicates to provide a cohesive service to the user.

---

## Additional Notes

- **Asynchronous Programming:** The use of `asyncio` allows agents to perform tasks concurrently.
- **Mock Implementations:** The functions `search_flights`, `search_hotels`, and `suggest_activities` are mock implementations. In a real-world application, you'd integrate with actual APIs.
- **Error Handling:** For production use, add proper error handling and input validation.
- **Extensibility:** You can extend this application by adding more agents, such as a `CarRentalAgent` or `RestaurantAgent`.

**Happy Coding!**
