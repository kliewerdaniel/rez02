# EchoShelf: Enterprise Voice Annotation System for Inventory Management and Beyond

## Transforming Team Communication Through Voice-to-Knowledge Technology

In today's fast-paced business environments, communication gaps between field teams and management can lead to significant operational inefficiencies. Whether it's inventory discrepancies in retail, maintenance observations in manufacturing, or field notes in construction, critical information often goes unrecorded due to the friction of documentation.

EchoShelf addresses this challenge by providing a seamless voice annotation system that transforms spoken observations into structured, searchable knowledge. Initially designed for inventory management, the platform's architecture supports broader enterprise applications across industries where real-time documentation and team synchronization are essential.

## Business Applications Beyond Inventory

While EchoShelf began as an inventory management solution, its architecture supports numerous business use cases:

- **Retail Operations**: Store managers can push planogram updates while associates document stock irregularities
- **Facility Management**: Maintenance teams capture equipment observations while supervisors distribute work orders
- **Healthcare**: Clinical staff document patient observations while administrators manage compliance notes
- **Field Services**: Technicians record on-site findings while managers distribute service priorities
- **Manufacturing**: Line workers report quality issues while supervisors disseminate procedural changes

The bidirectional nature of EchoShelf—enabling both frontline documentation and management communication—creates a continuous feedback loop that keeps entire organizations aligned.

## Core System Architecture

EchoShelf employs a modular architecture combining voice processing, AI transcription, and enterprise integration capabilities:

### Backend Framework (FastAPI)

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException, Depends, File, UploadFile
from typing import Optional, List
from datetime import datetime

from .services import transcription, ai_processing, database, notification
from .auth import get_current_user, UserRole
from .models import MemoCreate, MemoResponse, DailyReport

app = FastAPI(title="EchoShelf API")

@app.post("/api/memos", response_model=MemoResponse)
async def create_memo(
    item_id: str,
    location_id: str,
    audio_file: UploadFile = File(...),
    current_user = Depends(get_current_user)
):
    """
    Process and store a voice annotation with associated metadata.
    """
    # Implementation details for processing voice annotations
    # 1. Validate the incoming request
    # 2. Save audio file temporarily
    # 3. Process audio through transcription service
    # 4. Extract entities and metadata with AI
    # 5. Store in database with user attribution
    # 6. Return structured response
    
@app.get("/api/reports/daily", response_model=DailyReport)
async def get_daily_report(
    date: Optional[datetime] = None,
    department: Optional[str] = None,
    current_user = Depends(get_current_user)
):
    """
    Retrieve the daily summary report for a specific date and department.
    """
    # Implementation for generating or retrieving daily reports
```

### Transcription Service

```python
import whisper
from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import Dict, Any

class TranscriptionResult(BaseModel):
    text: str
    confidence: float
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]

class TranscriptionService:
    def __init__(self, model_name: str = "base"):
        """Initialize the Whisper transcription service with selected model."""
        self.model = whisper.load_model(model_name)
    
    async def transcribe(self, audio_path: str) -> TranscriptionResult:
        """
        Transcribe audio file to text using OpenAI's Whisper.
        Returns structured result with confidence score and metadata.
        """
        # Implementation would include:
        # 1. Processing the audio file
        # 2. Running Whisper transcription
        # 3. Adding confidence metadata
        # 4. Returning structured results
```

### AI Processing Service

```python

    def __init__(self, model_name: str = "llama2"):
        """Initialize AI processing with the specified LLM."""
        self.client = Client()
        self.model = model_name
    
    async def extract_entities(self, transcript: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """
        Extract structured information from transcribed text.
        """
        prompt = f"""
        Extract from the following inventory or business note: {transcript}
        Return a JSON object with the following information:
        - item_name: The product or item mentioned
        - location: Where the item is located
        - issue: The problem or situation described
        - action_taken: Any action that was already performed
        - action_needed: Any action that needs to be taken
        - priority: High, Medium, or Low based on urgency
        """
        
        response = self.client.generate(model=self.model, prompt=prompt)
        try:
            # Process and validate the LLM response
            # Return structured entity data
            pass

  };

  const submitRecording = async () => {
    // Implementation for submitting recording
    // 1. Create FormData with audio and metadata
    // 2. Submit to API
    // 3. Handle response
    // 4. Call completion callback
  };

  return (
    <div className="voice-recorder">
      {/* UI implementation with recording controls */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default VoiceRecorder;
```

### Management Dashboard

const ManagerDashboard = () => {
  const [report, setReport] = useState(null);
  const [recentMemos, setRecentMemos] = useState([]);
  const [selectedDepartment, setSelectedDepartment] = useState('all');
  const [dateRange, setDateRange] = useState({ start: null, end: null });
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Load initial dashboard data
    loadDashboardData();
  }, [selectedDepartment, dateRange]);
  
  const loadDashboardData = async () => {
    // Implementation for loading dashboard data
    // 1. Fetch daily report
    // 2. Fetch recent memos
    // 3. Update state
  };
  
  const distributeReport = async (channels) => {
    // Implementation for distributing report
    // 1. Select distribution channels (email, print, etc)
    // 2. Call API to trigger distribution
    // 3. Show confirmation
  };
  
  return (
