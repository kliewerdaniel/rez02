- **Node.js & npm:** Latest LTS version
- **Git:** Installed and configured
- **Virtual Environment Tool:** `venv` or `virtualenv` for Python
- **Backend Dependencies:** Listed in `requirements.txt`
- **Frontend Dependencies:** Managed via `package.json`

### Installation Steps

Follow these steps to install and set up GhostWriter on your local machine:

#### 1. Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning the GhostWriter repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kliewerdaniel/GhostWriter.git
cd GhostWriter
```

#### 2. Backend Setup

GhostWriter's backend is built with Django, a robust Python web framework.

##### a. Create a Virtual Environment

It's best practice to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- **On macOS/Linux:**

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

- **On Windows:**

  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

##### b. Install Backend Dependencies

Navigate to the `backend` directory and install the required Python packages:

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. Frontend Setup

GhostWriter's frontend is developed using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

##### a. Navigate to the Frontend Directory

From the root project directory, move to the `frontend` folder:

```bash
cd ../frontend
```

##### b. Install Frontend Dependencies

Use `npm` or `yarn` to install the necessary packages:

- **Using npm:**

  ```bash
  npm install
  ```

- **Using yarn:**

  ```bash
  yarn install
  ```

#### 4. Configure Environment Variables

GhostWriter utilizes environment variables to manage sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, and secret keys.

##### a. Backend `.env` Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and add the following variables:

```bash
cd ../backend
touch .env
```

**Sample `.env` Content:**

```bash
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your_django_secret_key
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/ghostwriter_db
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key
```

**Notes:**

- **`DEBUG`**: Set to `False` in production environments.
- **`SECRET_KEY`**: Generate a strong secret key for Django.
- **`DATABASE_URL`**: Configure your database connection. GhostWriter uses PostgreSQL by default.
- **`JWT_SECRET_KEY`**: Secure key for JWT authentication.

##### b. Frontend `.env` Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory:

```bash
cd ../frontend
touch .env
```

**Sample `.env` Content:**

```bash
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/
REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

**Notes:**

- **`REACT_APP_API_URL`**: Base URL for backend API requests.
- **`REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY`**: If GhostWriter integrates with OpenAI for AI functionalities, provide your API key here.

#### 5. Run the Application

With both backend and frontend set up, you're ready to run GhostWriter.

##### a. Start the Backend Server

Ensure you're in the `backend` directory with the virtual environment activated:

```bash
cd ../backend
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

**Explanation:**

- **`python manage.py migrate`**: Applies database migrations.
- **`python manage.py runserver`**: Starts the Django development server on `http://localhost:8000/`.

##### b. Start the Frontend Server

Open a new terminal window/tab, navigate to the `frontend` directory, and start the React development server:

```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

**Explanation:**

- **`npm start`**: Launches the React app on `http://localhost:3000/` by default.

**Note:** If the port `3000` is in use, React will prompt you to run on a different port.

## Troubleshooting

While installing and using GhostWriter, you might encounter some common issues. Here's how to address them:

### 1. Environment Variables Not Loading

**Solution:**

- Ensure that the `.env` files are correctly placed in the `backend` and `frontend` directories.
- Verify that the variable names are correctly prefixed, especially for React (e.g., `REACT_APP_`).

### 2. Database Connection Errors

**Solution:**

- Check your `DATABASE_URL` in the backend `.env` file.
- Ensure that PostgreSQL is installed and running.
- Verify that the database credentials are correct.

### 3. JWT Authentication Issues

**Solution:**

- Ensure that `JWT_SECRET_KEY` is set in the backend `.env` file.
- Verify that the token is being correctly attached to API requests in the frontend.
- Check backend settings to ensure `rest_framework_simplejwt.authentication.JWTAuthentication` is included in `DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES`.

### 4. Port Conflicts

**Solution:**

- If `localhost:8000` or `localhost:3000` is in use, specify a different port when running the servers.
  - **Django:** `python manage.py runserver 8001`
  - **React:** Respond to the prompt to run on a different port or set it manually.

### 5. Missing Dependencies

**Solution:**

- Ensure all dependencies are installed by rerunning the installation commands.
  - **Backend:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - **Frontend:** `npm install` or `yarn install`
