# **Mastering Burn for AI: Training, Saving, and Running Local Models in Rust**

If you're passionate about performance-first AI without Python bloat, you've found the right guide. Today we're combining model training, serialization, and inference using Rust's Burn framework - **all native, all efficient, and fully under your control**.

---

## **Why Burn + Rust? The Future of Lean AI**

Before we dive into code, let's address why this stack matters:

- **ðŸš€ Rust Performance**: Memory safety + C++-level speed
- **ðŸ“¦ Minimal Dependencies**: No Python, no 2GB PyTorch installs
- **ðŸ”„ Full Workflow Control**: Train, save, load - all in one language
- **ðŸ”— Cross-Platform**: CPU, CUDA, Metal, WebGPU via Burn's unified backend

Burn isn't just another framework - it's **Rust's answer to production-ready AI**.

---

## **Step 1: Environment Setup**

### **Install Rust**
Skip this if already installed:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### **Create Project**
```bash
cargo new burn_ai
cd burn_ai
```

### **Configure Dependencies**
Add to `Cargo.toml`:
```toml
[dependencies]
burn = { version = "0.10", features = ["ndarray"] }
burn-model = "0.10"
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
```

---

## **Step 2: Define Your AI Model**

Create `src/main.rs` with our neural network:

```rust
use burn::tensor::{Tensor, backend::NdArrayBackend};
use burn::nn::{Linear, Relu, Model, Learner};
use burn::optim::{Adam, Optimizer};
use std::fs::{File, BufWriter, BufReader};

#[derive(Model)]
struct SimpleNN {
    layer1: Linear<NdArrayBackend>,
    layer2: Linear<NdArrayBackend>,
}

impl SimpleNN {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            layer1: Linear::new(2, 4),  // 2 inputs â†’ 4 neurons
            layer2: Linear::new(4, 1),  // 4 neurons â†’ 1 output
        }
    }

    fn forward(&self, input: Tensor<NdArrayBackend, 2>) -> Tensor<NdArrayBackend, 2> {
        let hidden = self.layer1.forward(input);
        let activation = Relu::new().forward(hidden);
        self.layer2.forward(activation)
    }
}
```

---

## **Step 3: Train and Save the Model**

Add training logic to `main()`:

```rust
fn main() {
    // Initialize model and optimizer
    let mut model = SimpleNN::new();
    let optimizer = Adam::new(&model, 0.01);
    
    // Synthetic training data
    let inputs = Tensor::from_data([[0.5, 0.8], [0.3, 0.7]]);  // Input samples
    let targets = Tensor::from_data([[1.0], [0.5]]);           // Expected outputs

    // Training loop
    for _ in 0..1000 {
        let predictions = model.forward(inputs.clone());
        let loss = (predictions - targets.clone()).powf(2.0).sum();  // MSE loss
        optimizer.backward_step(&loss);  // Update weights
    }

    // Save trained model
    save_model(&model, "trained_model.burn");
    println!("Model trained and saved!");
}

fn save_model(model: &SimpleNN, path: &str) {
    let file = File::create(path).expect("Failed to create model file");
    let writer = BufWriter::new(file);
    model.save(writer).expect("Failed to save model");
}
```

Run with:
```bash
cargo run
```

You'll now have `trained_model.burn` - your portable AI brain.

---

## **Step 4: Load and Run Inference**

Modify `main()` to load and use the saved model:

```rust
fn main() {
    // Load trained model
    let model = load_model("trained_model.burn");
    
    // New input data for prediction
    let new_data = Tensor::from_data([[0.9, 0.4]]);
    
    // Run inference
    let prediction = model.forward(new_data);
    println!("Model prediction: {:?}", prediction);
}

fn load_model(path: &str) -> SimpleNN {
    let file = File::open(path).expect("Failed to open model file");
    let reader = BufReader::new(file);
    SimpleNN::load(reader).expect("Failed to load model")
}
```

Run again:
```bash
cargo run
```

**Output:**
```
Model prediction: Tensor([[0.87642]])  # Your actual value may vary
```

## **Key Advantages of This Workflow**

1. **Self-Contained AI**  
No Python â†” Rust bridge - everything stays in Rust's memory-safe environment.

2. **Lightweight Deployment**  
A single `.burn` file contains all model parameters and architecture.

3. **Hardware Flexibility**  
Switch backends (CPU/GPU) by changing Burn's feature flags - no code changes needed.

4. **Production Ready**  
Compile to native code for servers, IoT, or web via WebAssembly.

---

## **Next Steps: Leveling Up Your Burn Skills**

- **Experiment with Backends**: Try `features = ["wgpu"]` for GPU acceleration
- **Add More Layers**: Extend `SimpleNN` with convolutional or recurrent layers
- **Optimize Quantization**: Burn supports 8-bit weights for mobile deployment
- **Explore Transfer Learning**: Load partial models and fine-tune

---

We've just demonstrated a complete AI workflow:

1. Model definition in Rust  
2. Training with automatic differentiation  
3. Serialization to a compact file  
4. Loading and inference without dependencies  

Burn eliminates the need for Python in production AI while matching its flexibility. As the framework matures, we're looking at **Rust becoming the de facto language for performance-critical AI**.

The AI revolution doesn't have to be slow, bloated, or dependent on a single language stack. With Burn, we're building the future - one safe, fast tensor at a time.

## **Why Rust? Why Python? And Why Together?**

Rust has been the rising star in systems programming for years, and for good reason:

- **Memory safety without garbage collection**
- **Blazing fast performance**
- **Concurrency that actually works without race conditions**
- **Interoperability with other languages** (yes, including Python)

Meanwhile, Python is still the king of AI and data science. But Python is slow. The good news? We can offload performance-heavy parts of our AI pipelines to Rust and call them from Python.

By doing this, we get:
- The speed of Rust where it matters
- The flexibility of Python for AI models and orchestration
- A cleaner separation of concerns

Now, letâ€™s get into the code.

---

## **Step 1: Setting Up a Rust Library**

### **Installing Rust**
First, install Rust if you havenâ€™t already:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```
This gives you `cargo`, Rustâ€™s package manager, which weâ€™ll use to create our project.

### **Create a New Rust Library**
Weâ€™re going to create a new Rust library (`--lib` means itâ€™s not an executable binary):
```bash
cargo new --lib rust_ai
cd rust_ai
```
This gives us a `Cargo.toml` and a `src/lib.rs` file.

---

## **Step 2: Writing the Rust Code**

Weâ€™ll write a simple Rust function that performs matrix multiplication. Why? Because AI loves matrices, and Python loves being slow at multiplying them.

Edit `src/lib.rs`:
```rust
use pyo3::prelude::*;
use ndarray::Array2;

#[pyfunction]
fn multiply_matrices(a: Vec<Vec<f64>>, b: Vec<Vec<f64>>) -> PyResult<Vec<Vec<f64>>> {
    let a = Array2::from_shape_vec((a.len(), a[0].len()), a.into_iter().flatten().collect())
        .map_err(|_| PyErr::new::<pyo3::exceptions::PyValueError, _>("Invalid matrix shape"))?;
    let b = Array2::from_shape_vec((b.len(), b[0].len()), b.into_iter().flatten().collect())
        .map_err(|_| PyErr::new::<pyo3::exceptions::PyValueError, _>("Invalid matrix shape"))?;
    
    let result = a.dot(&b);
    
    let result_vec = result.rows().into_iter()
        .map(|row| row.to_vec())
        .collect();
    
    Ok(result_vec)
}

#[pymodule]
fn rust_ai(py: Python, m: &PyModule) -> PyResult<()> {
    m.add_function(wrap_pyfunction!(multiply_matrices, m)?)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

Whatâ€™s happening here?
- Weâ€™re using **ndarray**, a Rust library for numerical computing, to handle matrix operations.
- We define a Python-callable function `multiply_matrices` that takes two 2D vectors, performs matrix multiplication, and returns the result.
- We use `PyO3` to expose this function to Python.

Next, update `Cargo.toml` to include dependencies:
```toml
[dependencies]
pyo3 = { version = "0.18", features = ["extension-module"] }
ndarray = "0.15"
```

Now, letâ€™s compile it into a Python module.

---

## **Step 3: Building and Using the Rust Module in Python**

First, install `maturin`, which handles Python packaging for Rust extensions:
```bash
pip install maturin
```

Then, build and install the module:
```bash
maturin develop
```
Now we can use it in Python:
```python
import rust_ai

a = [[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]]
b = [[5.0, 6.0], [7.0, 8.0]]

result = rust_ai.multiply_matrices(a, b)
print(result)  # [[19.0, 22.0], [43.0, 50.0]]
```
Boom. Fast, safe, and ready for AI workloads.

---

## **Step 4: Integrating with OpenAI Agents**

Now letâ€™s integrate this into [openai-agents-python](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python.git).

### **Modifying an AI Agent to Use Rust**

In an OpenAI-powered agent, you can define custom tools. Letâ€™s say we want our AI agent to use our Rust matrix multiplication function:

```python
import rust_ai
from openai_agents import Agent

def matrix_tool(a, b):
    return rust_ai.multiply_matrices(a, b)

agent = Agent(tools={"multiply_matrices": matrix_tool})

response = agent.run("Multiply these matrices: [[1,2],[3,4]] and [[5,6],[7,8]]")
print(response)
```
Now, the agent can call Rust when it needs to perform matrix multiplications. This is useful for AI models that involve real-time numerical processing, such as reinforcement learning or advanced statistical computations.

---

## **Conclusion: Rust + Python = AI Powerhouse**

With just a little effort, we:
- Built a Rust library that speeds up matrix operations
- Exposed it to Python using PyO3
- Integrated it with OpenAIâ€™s agent framework

This is just the beginning. Rust can handle much heavier liftingâ€”like SIMD-optimized tensor computations, fast graph algorithms, or even custom LLM model inference. The point is: if you care about performance, security, and keeping AI workloads efficient, Rust deserves a place in your stack.

The AI world is moving fast, and the divide between research and practical implementation is only growing. If you want to be ahead of the curve, mastering hybrid Rust/Python applications for AI is the way forward.

Stay tuned for more deep dives. Letâ€™s build cool things. ðŸš€
